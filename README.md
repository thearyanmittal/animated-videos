## Hess's Law
Hess's Law is a method used to calculate the enthalpy of a reaction given the enthalpies of its component reactions. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb60__0niwM "Hess's Law Video") helps one understand the steps involved in this computation.


## Newton's Method
Newton's Method is a process used to approximate zeros of a function (to an arbitrary level of precision) by computing the convergence of the zeros of the derivative of the function evaluated at certain points. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hckAj-Y3je8 "Newton's Method Video") helps one visualize this process.
